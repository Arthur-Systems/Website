<p><b>George Washington</b> (February 22, 1732<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[b]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-calendar_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-calendar-5">[c]</a></sup>&#160;– <span class="nowrap">December 14</span>, 1799) was an American statesman and soldier who served as the first <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> from 1789 to 1797 and was one of the <a href="/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States" title="Founding Fathers of the United States">Founding Fathers of the United States</a>. He served as <a href="/wiki/Commander-in-chief#United_States" title="Commander-in-chief">Commander-in-Chief</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Continental_Army" title="Continental Army">Continental Army</a> during the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>, and later presided over the <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)" title="Constitutional Convention (United States)">1787 convention</a> that drafted the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>. As a driving force behind the nation's establishment he came to be known as the "<a href="/wiki/Father_of_the_country" class="mw-redirect" title="Father of the country">father of the country</a>," both during his lifetime and to this day.</p>
<p>Washington was born into the provincial gentry of <a href="/wiki/Colonial_Virginia" class="mw-redirect" title="Colonial Virginia">Colonial Virginia</a> to a family of wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves, which he inherited. In his youth, he became a senior officer in the <a href="/wiki/Colonial_militia" class="mw-redirect" title="Colonial militia">colonial militia</a> during the first stages of the <a href="/wiki/French_and_Indian_War" title="French and Indian War">French and Indian War</a>. He gradually grew indifferent to British rule with its lack of colonial representation in <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain" title="Parliament of Great Britain">British Parliament</a> and excessive taxation on the colonies. In 1775, the <a href="/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress" title="Second Continental Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> commissioned him as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution. In that command, Washington <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Boston" title="Siege of Boston">drove the British</a> out of Boston in 1776, but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when he <a href="/wiki/New_York_and_New_Jersey_campaign#Capture_of_New_York_City" title="New York and New Jersey campaign">lost New York City</a>. After <a href="/wiki/George_Washington%27s_crossing_of_the_Delaware_River" title="George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River">crossing the Delaware River</a> in the middle of winter, he defeated the British in two battles, retook New Jersey, and restored momentum to the <a href="/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)" title="Patriot (American Revolution)">Patriot</a> cause. Washington's strategy enabled Continental forces to ultimately defeat the British. Historians laud Washington for the selection and supervision of his generals, preservation and command of the army, coordination with the Congress, state governors, and their militia, and attention to supplies, logistics, and training. In battle, however, Washington was sometimes outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies, yet was always able to avoid significant defeats which would have resulted in the surrender of his army and the loss of the American Revolution.</p>
<p>After victory had been finalized in 1783, Washington resigned as commander-in-chief rather than remaining in power, proving his commitment to <a href="/wiki/American_republicanism" class="mw-redirect" title="American republicanism">American republicanism</a>. Washington presided over the <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)" title="Constitutional Convention (United States)">Constitutional Convention in 1787</a>, which devised a new form of <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">federal government</a> for the United States. Washington was widely admired for his strong <a href="/wiki/Leadership_qualities" class="mw-redirect" title="Leadership qualities">leadership qualities</a> and was unanimously elected president by the <a href="/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)" title="Electoral College (United States)">Electoral College</a> in the first two national elections. Following his election as president in <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1788%E2%80%931789" class="mw-redirect" title="United States presidential election, 1788–1789">1789</a>, he worked to unify rival factions in the fledgling nation. He helped pass <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>'s programs to satisfy federal and state debts to establish a permanent seat of government, to implement an effective tax system, and to create a national bank.</p>
<p>In avoiding war with Great Britain, he guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the <a href="/wiki/Jay_Treaty" title="Jay Treaty">Jay Treaty</a> in 1795, despite intense opposition from the <a href="/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party" title="Democratic-Republican Party">Jeffersonians</a>. He oversaw the creation of a strong, well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars" title="French Revolutionary Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, suppressed the <a href="/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion" title="Whiskey Rebellion">Whiskey Rebellion</a>, and won wide acceptance among Americans. Washington's incumbency established many precedents still in use today, such as the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Cabinet" class="mw-redirect" title="United States Cabinet">cabinet system</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration" title="United States presidential inauguration">inaugural address</a>, and the title <a href="/wiki/Mr._President_(title)" title="Mr. President (title)">Mr. President</a>. His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1940" title="United States presidential election, 1940">1940</a> and was later made law by the <a href="/wiki/22nd_Amendment" class="mw-redirect" title="22nd Amendment">22nd Amendment</a>. He remained non-partisan, never joining the <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Party" title="Federalist Party">Federalist Party</a>, although he largely supported its policies. By 1794, Congress was divided between two parties, that had stemmed from a political-personal feud between Washington's two secretaries, Hamilton and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>. <a href="/wiki/Washington%27s_Farewell_Address" class="mw-redirect" title="Washington's Farewell Address">Washington's Farewell Address</a> was an influential primer on <a href="/wiki/Civic_virtue" title="Civic virtue">civic virtue</a>, warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars.</p>
<p>He retired from the presidency in 1797, returning to his home and beloved plantation at <a href="/wiki/Mount_Vernon" title="Mount Vernon">Mount Vernon</a>. Upon his death, Washington was eulogized as "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen". He was revered in life and in death; scholarly and public polling <a href="/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States" class="mw-redirect" title="Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States">consistently ranks</a> him among the top three presidents in American history. He has been <a href="/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_George_Washington" title="Cultural depictions of George Washington">depicted</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_monuments_dedicated_to_George_Washington" class="mw-redirect" title="List of monuments dedicated to George Washington">remembered</a> in monuments, <a href="/wiki/Public_works" title="Public works">public works</a>, currency, and other dedications to the present day.</p>

<p>In 1755, Washington became the senior American aide to British General <a href="/wiki/Edward_Braddock" title="Edward Braddock">Edward Braddock</a> on the ill-fated Braddock expedition. This was the largest British expedition to the colonies, and was intended to expel the French from the Ohio Country; the first objective was the capture of <a href="/wiki/Fort_Duquesne" title="Fort Duquesne">Fort Duquesne</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAlden199335–36_50-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlden199335–36-50">[45]</a></sup> Washington initially sought an appointment as a major from Braddock, but he agreed to serve as a staff volunteer upon advice that no rank above captain could be given except by London. During the passage of the expedition, Washington fell ill with severe headaches and fever. He recommended to Braddock that the army be split into two divisions when the pace of the troops continued to slow: a primary and more lightly equipped "flying column" offensive which could move at a more rapid pace, to be followed by a more heavily armed reinforcing division. Braddock accepted the recommendation (likely made in a <a href="/wiki/Council_of_war" title="Council of war">council of war</a> including other officers) and took command of the lead division.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAlden199337Ferling201035–36_51-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlden199337Ferling201035–36-51">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Monongahela" title="Battle of the Monongahela">Battle of the Monongahela</a>, the French and their Indian allies ambushed Braddock's reduced forces and the general was mortally wounded. After suffering devastating casualties, the British panicked and retreated in disarray. Washington rode back and forth across the battlefield, rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces into an organized retreat. In the process, he demonstrated bravery and stamina, despite his lingering illness. He had two horses shot from underneath him, while his hat and coat were pierced by several bullets. Two-thirds of the British force of 976 men were killed or wounded in the battle. Washington's conduct in the battle redeemed his reputation among many who had criticized his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFerling200928–30_52-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFerling200928–30-52">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>Washington was not included by the succeeding commander Col.

<p>On August 14, 1755 Lt. Governor Dinwiddie rewarded Washington with a commission as "Colonel of the Virginia Regiment and Commander in Chief of all forces now raised in the defense of His Majesty's Colony" and gave him the task of defending Virginia's frontier. The <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Regiment" title="Virginia Regiment">Virginia Regiment</a> was the first full-time American military unit in the colonies, as opposed to part-time militias and the British regular units. He was ordered to "act defensively or offensively" as he thought best.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFlexner1965138_54-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlexner1965138-54">[49]</a></sup> He happily accepted the commission, but the coveted red coat of officer rank (and the accompanying pay) continued to elude him.

<p>In command of a thousand soldiers, Washington was a disciplinarian who emphasized training. He led his men in brutal campaigns against the Indians in the west; his regiment fought 20 battles in 10 months and lost a third of its men. Washington's strenuous efforts meant that Virginia's frontier population suffered less than that of other colonies; Ellis concludes that "it was his only unqualified success" in that war.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFischer200415–16Ellis382004_56-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFischer200415–16Ellis382004-56">[51]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1758, Colonel Washington participated in the <a href="/wiki/Forbes_Expedition" title="Forbes Expedition">Forbes Expedition</a> to capture Fort Duquesne. He was embarrassed by a friendly fire episode in which his unit and another British unit each thought that the other was the French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap. Washington was not involved in any other major fighting on the expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley when the French abandoned the fort. Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758.

<p>Washington became a political figure and soon emerged as a leader in the social elite in Virginia. From 1768 to 1775, he invited some 2,000 guests to his Mount Vernon estate, mostly those whom he considered "people of rank". As for people not of high social status, his advice was to "treat them civilly" but "keep them at a proper distance, for they will grow upon familiarity, in proportion as you sink in authority".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFischer200414_88-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFischer200414-88">[81]</a></sup> In 1769, he became more politically active, presenting the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Assembly" class="mw-redirect" title="Virginia Assembly">Virginia Assembly</a> with legislation for an <a href="/wiki/Embargo" class="mw-redirect" title="Embargo">embargo</a> on goods from Great Britain.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFerling200073–76_89-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFerling200073–76-89">[82]</a></sup></p>

<p>General Washington essentially assumed three roles during the war. First, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775–77 and again in 1781. He lost many of his battles, but he never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end. He plotted the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHigginbotham1985ch._3_102-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHigginbotham1985ch._3-102">[95]</a></sup> Second, he was charged with organizing and training the army. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_von_Steuben" title="Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben">Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben</a> to train them, a veteran of the Prussian general staff.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERandall1997342,_359_103-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERandall1997342,_359-103">[96]</a></sup> The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFreedman200842Carp1990220_104-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFreedman200842Carp1990220-104">[97]</a></sup></p>
<p>In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as "Board of War and Ordnance", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFreedman200842_105-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFreedman200842-105">[98]</a></sup> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as <a href="/wiki/John_Sullivan_(general)" title="John Sullivan (general)">John Sullivan</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHigginbotham1985ch._3_102-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHigginbotham1985ch._3-102">[95]</a></sup> Eventually, he found capable officers such as General <a href="/wiki/Nathanael_Greene" title="Nathanael Greene">Nathanael Greene</a>, General <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Morgan" title="Daniel Morgan">Daniel Morgan</a> ("the old wagoner" with whom he had served in <a href="/wiki/The_French_and_Indian_War" class="mw-redirect" title="The French and Indian War">The French and Indian War</a>), Colonel <a href="/wiki/Henry_Knox" title="Henry Knox">Henry Knox</a> (chief of artillery), and Colonel <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), <a href="/wiki/Battles_of_Saratoga" title="Battles of Saratoga">Saratoga</a> (1777), and <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown" title="Siege of Yorktown">Yorktown</a> (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHigginbotham1985ch._3_102-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHigginbotham1985ch._3-102">[95]</a></sup></p>
<p>Washington's third and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as erratic militias. (This was clearly demonstrated in the rout at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Camden" title="Battle of Camden">Camden</a>, where only the Maryland and Delaware Continentals held firm under <a href="/wiki/Baron_DeKalb" class="mw-redirect" title="Baron DeKalb">Baron DeKalb</a>.)<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJensen2002_106-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJensen2002-106">[99]</a></sup></p>

<p>Washington assumed command of the Continental Army in the field at Cambridge, Massachusetts in July 1775 during the ongoing <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Boston" title="Siege of Boston">siege of Boston</a>. He recognized his army's desperate shortage of gunpowder and sought new sources. American troops raided British arsenals, including some in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, and some manufacturing was attempted. They obtained a barely adequate supply (about 2.5&#160;million pounds) by the end of 1776, mostly from France.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStephenson1925271–81_107-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStephenson1925271–81-107">[100]</a></sup></p>
<p>Washington reorganized the army during the long standoff in Boston and forced the British to withdraw by putting artillery on <a href="/wiki/Fortification_of_Dorchester_Heights" title="Fortification of Dorchester Heights">Dorchester Heights</a> overlooking the city. The British <a href="/wiki/Evacuation_Day_(Massachusetts)" title="Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)">evacuated Boston</a> in March 1776 and Washington moved his army to New York City.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELengel2005124—126Higginbotham1985125–34_108-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTELengel2005124—126Higginbotham1985125–34-108">[101]</a></sup></p>

<p>In August 1776, British General <a href="/wiki/William_Howe,_5th_Viscount_Howe" title="William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe">William Howe</a> launched a massive <a href="/wiki/New_York_and_New_Jersey_campaign" title="New York and New Jersey campaign">naval and land campaign</a> designed to seize New York.

<p>Washington had considered abandoning the island and <a href="/wiki/Fort_Washington_(New_York)" class="mw-redirect" title="Fort Washington (New York)">Fort Washington</a>, but he heeded Generals Greene and <a href="/wiki/Israel_Putnam" title="Israel Putnam">Putnam's</a> recommendation to attempt a defense of the fort.

<p>Retreating from his defeat in New York, Washington continued his flight across New Jersey and across the <a href="/wiki/Delaware_River" title="Delaware River">Delaware River</a> into Pennsylvania, with Howe's troops pursuing most of the way.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFischer2004224-226_117-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFischer2004224-226-117">[108]</a></sup> The future of the Continental Army was in doubt due to poor supply, lack of adequate clothing and boots along with expiring enlistments and many desertions along the way.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKetchum1999235Chernow2010264_118-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKetchum1999235Chernow2010264-118">[109]</a></sup> He was disappointed to find that many New Jersey residents were Loyalists, or simply very skeptical about the prospect of Independence. The over confident General Howe assumed that Washington and his men would never be able to cross the Delaware, decided not to advance on Philadelphia and instead bided his time and took up winter quarters in <a href="/wiki/Trenton,_New_Jersey" title="Trenton, New Jersey">Trenton, New Jersey</a> situated on the east shore of the Delaware. Learning about the complacency of Howe and his Hessian <a href="/wiki/Mercenaries" class="mw-redirect" title="Mercenaries">mercenaries</a>, and prompted by desperate conditions and expiring enlistments, Washington gathered with his generals on Christmas Eve at the home of Samuel Merrick and devised a plan to cross the icy Delaware at night and surprise the British/Hessian garrison encamped there. By sundown stormy weather was increasing and a light rain began to fall. Before the mass crossing, Washington had crossed the river and staked out an area on the New Jersey shore where his troops would land. In the mean time, he had his men search along the Delaware for sixty miles for sturdy boats and barges suitable for transporting troops and supply, commandeer what could be used for the crossing and to destroy any that could later be used by the British. Many <a href="/wiki/Durham_boat" title="Durham boat">Durham boats</a><sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[j]</a></sup> were found and used in the crossing.

On the night of December 25–26, 1776, he led his army across the Delaware, with eighteen pieces of artillery, while struggling with rapid currents and ice hindering their way. Washington divided his forces into three groups, with two of them failing to make it across the river.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFischer2004215–217_122-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFischer2004215–217-122">[112]</a></sup></p>

<p>Washington's army of 11,000 went into winter quarters at <a href="/wiki/Valley_Forge" title="Valley Forge">Valley Forge</a> north of Philadelphia in December 1777. Over the next six months, the deaths in camp numbered in the thousands, the majority being from disease, compounded by lack of food and proper clothing, poor shelter, and the extreme cold. Historians' death toll estimates range from 2,000 to over 3,000 men.</p>

In contrast, Washington had difficulty procuring supplies from the few farmers in the area who would not accept rapidly depreciating American paper currency, while the woodlands about the valley had soon been exhausted of game. As conditions worsened, Washington was faced with the task of maintaining morale and discouraging desertion, which had become common by February.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAlden1993165_138-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlden1993165-138">[128]</a></sup></p>
<p>Washington had repeatedly petitioned the <a href="/wiki/Continental_Congress" title="Continental Congress">Continental Congress</a> for badly needed provisions but with no success. Finally, on January 24, 1778, five Congressmen came to Valley Forge to examine the conditions of the Continental Army. Washington expressed the urgency of the situation, exclaiming, "Something must be done. Important alterations must be made." At this time, he also contended that Congress should take control of the army supply system, pay for its supplies, and promptly expedite them as they became necessary. In response to Washington's urgent appeal, Congress gave full support to funding the supply lines of the army, which also resulted in reorganizing the <a href="/wiki/Commissariat" title="Commissariat">commissary</a> department, which controlled gathering the supplies for the army. By late February, there were adequate supplies flowing throughout camp.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFreedman200842_105-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFreedman200842-105">[98]</a></sup> The next spring, a revitalized army emerged from Valley Forge in good order, thanks in part to a full-scale training program supervised by General von Steuben.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAlden1993168_139-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlden1993168-139">[129]</a></sup> The British evacuated Philadelphia for New York in June 1778.

<p>Substantial combat had ended but the war had not, and a formal treaty of peace was months away. The British still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, and had a powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. Money matters fed anxiety; the treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive almost to the point of mutiny. At one point, they forced an adjournment of the Congress from Philadelphia to Princeton.

<p>Two of Washington's Cabinet members, Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State, and Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury, were diametrically opposed in political principles. Like Washington, Hamilton believed in a strong national government that needed a national bank and foreign loans to function, while Jefferson believed the government should be primarily under the direction of the states and the common workers and deeply resented the idea of banks and foreign dependency.

<p>In March 1791, Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits to help pay the national debt; grain farmers strongly protested in frontier districts, especially the westernmost counties of Pennsylvania, saying they were unrepresented and were unfairly shouldering too much of the debt. Threats and violence against tax collectors escalated into full-scale defiance of federal authority in 1794, known as the <a href="/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion" title="Whiskey Rebellion">Whiskey Rebellion</a>.

<a href="/wiki/George_Washington%27s_Farewell_Address" title="George Washington's Farewell Address">Washington's Farewell Address</a> (September 19, 1796)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the months that led up to the end of Washington's presidency, he was relentlessly assailed by his political foes and a largely partisan press, which was highly critical of his numerous successes and Federalist leanings and accused him of being ambitious and greedy. He pointed out that he had taken no salary during the entire war, but he came to regard the press as an erosive and disuniting force, criticizing them for spreading numerous falsehoods and referring to them as "diabolical". This also had a great influence in his <a href="/wiki/George_Washington%27s_Farewell_Address" title="George Washington's Farewell Address">Farewell Address</a>, which expressed how troubled he was by the years of infighting and character assassination by much of the press.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERandall1997491—492Chernow2010752—754_239-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERandall1997491—492Chernow2010752—754-239">[222]</a></sup></p>
<p>Washington's Farewell Address was first published in the <i>American daily Advertiser</i> on September 19, 1796 and was one of the most influential statements on republicanism, drafted primarily by Washington himself with help from Hamilton. It gave advice on the necessity and importance of national union, the value of the Constitution and the rule of law, the evils of political parties, and the proper virtues of a republican people. He referred to morality as "a necessary spring of popular government". "Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason, and experience, both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."<sup id="cite_ref-240" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-240">[223]</a></sup></p>
<p>The address warned against foreign influence in domestic affairs and American meddling in European affairs, and against bitter partisanship in domestic politics. He also called for men to move beyond partisanship and serve the common good. He cautioned against "permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world",<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERandall1997492_241-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERandall1997492-241">[224]</a></sup> saying that the United States must concentrate primarily on American interests. He counseled friendship and commerce with all nations, but advised against involvement in European wars and entering into long-term "entangling" alliances, while advancing the general idea of non-involvement in foreign affairs. The Farewell Address made no clear distinction between domestic and foreign policies; John Quincy Adams interpreted Washington's policy as advocating a strong nationalist foreign policy while not limiting America's international activities. The address quickly set American values regarding foreign affairs. Washington's policy of non-involvement in the foreign affairs of the Old World was largely embraced by the founding generation of American statesmen, including John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. <sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFishmanPedersonRozell200119–20_242-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFishmanPedersonRozell200119–20-242">[225]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGregg1999199–216_243-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGregg1999199–216-243">[226]</a></sup></p>
<p>Washington's Farewell address, however, did not quell bi-partisan politics, but only served to aggravate them, setting the tone for the coming <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1796" title="United States presidential election, 1796">1796 election</a>, with Washington lending his support for John Adams.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERandall1997492_241-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERandall1997492-241">[224]</a></sup></p>

<p>Washington retired from the presidency in March 1797 and returned to Mount Vernon with a profound sense of relief. He devoted much time to his plantations and other business interests, including his distillery, which produced its first batch of spirits in February 1797.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBreenWhite2006209–20_244-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBreenWhite2006209–20-244">[227]</a></sup> His plantation operations were only minimally profitable.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChernow201053_32-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChernow201053-32">[28]</a></sup> His lands in the west (Piedmont) yielded little income because they were under attack by Indians, and the squatters living there refused to pay him rent. Washington attempted to sell off these holdings but failed to obtain the price that he desired. Meanwhile, he was losing money at Mount Vernon due to a glut of unproductive slaves, which he declined to sell due to a desire to keep families intact. In addition, some of the slaves belonged to Martha, but the groups had been living together for years and there had been much intermarriage among them.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEllis2004255–61_245-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEllis2004255–61-245">[228]</a></sup></p>
<p>Most Americans assumed that he was rich because of the well-known "glorified façade of wealth and grandeur" at Mount Vernon,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChernow2010ch._57,_note_38_246-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChernow2010ch._57,_note_38-246">[229]</a></sup> but nearly all of Washington's wealth was tied up in land or slaves. Historians estimate that his estate was worth about $1&#160;million in 1799 dollars, equivalent to about $19.9&#160;million in 2014.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDalzellDalzell1998219_247-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDalzellDalzell1998219-247">[230]</a></sup></p>
<p>By 1798, relations with France had deteriorated to the point that war seemed imminent. President Adams offered Washington a commission as <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_general_(United_States)" title="Lieutenant general (United States)">lieutenant general</a> on July 4, 1798, and as <a href="/wiki/Commander-in-chief" title="Commander-in-chief">Commander-in-chief</a> of the armies raised or to be raised for service in a <a href="/wiki/Quasi-War" title="Quasi-War">prospective war</a>.

He participated in planning for a Provisional Army to meet any emergency that might arise but avoided involvement in details as much as possible. He delegated most of the work to Hamilton, including active leadership of the army; Hamilton was serving as a major general in the U.S. Army at the time. No French army invaded the United States during this period, and Washington did not assume a field command <sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKohn1975225–42Grizzard2005264_248-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKohn1975225–42Grizzard2005264-248">[231]</a></sup> This was the only instance where a former President later served as an official presidential appointee up until 1921, when President <a href="/wiki/Warren_G._Harding" title="Warren G.

<p>On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington spent several hours inspecting his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail and freezing rain; that evening, not wanting to keep his guests waiting, he ate his supper without changing from his wet clothes. The next day the weather worsened with heavy snow. Now nursing a sore throat, he trudged down the hill towards the Potomac to mark some trees he wanted cleared. That evening he complained of chest congestion and hoarseness, but his mood remained cheerful. Some time around 3&#160;a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChernow2010806-10_251-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChernow2010806-10-251">[234]</a></sup> He was a firm believer in <a href="/wiki/Bloodletting" title="Bloodletting">bloodletting</a>, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation.

<p>A joint Congressional committee debated the removal of President Washington's body from Mount Vernon to a crypt in the Capitol in early 1832. The crypt was built by architect <a href="/wiki/Charles_Bulfinch" title="Charles Bulfinch">Charles Bulfinch</a> in the 1820s during the reconstruction of the burned-out capitol after the British had set it afire in August 1814, during the <a href="/wiki/Burning_of_Washington" title="Burning of Washington">Burning of Washington</a>. Southern opposition was intense, antagonized by an ever-growing rift between North and South.

<p>Washington was a tall man endowed with great physical strength that often amazed his subordinates and younger men. He was mostly silent during times of debate, yet he exhibited a commanding and sometimes domineering presence without having to speak.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERandall199734,_436_275-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERandall199734,_436-275">[256]</a></sup> His height was variously recorded as 6&#160;ft (1.83&#160;m) to 6&#160;ft 2&#160;in (1.88&#160;m), although he registered 6&#160;ft 3½ in when measured for his coffin.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChernow201029—30_276-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChernow201029—30-276">[257]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a young man, Washington had red hair. It is often assumed that he wore a wig, as was the fashion among some at the time, but he did not. Instead, he powdered his hair,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChernow201029—30_276-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChernow201029—30-276">[257]</a></sup> which is represented in several portraits including the unfinished <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_Stuart" title="Gilbert Stuart">Gilbert Stuart</a> depiction called the "Athenaeum Portrait".<sup id="cite_ref-Gilbert_Stuart_277-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gilbert_Stuart-277">[258]</a></sup></p>
<p>Washington was a very skilled horseman; Jefferson called him "the best horseman of his age", and both American and European observers praised his riding. The horsemanship benefited his hunting, a favorite hobby. He was an excellent dancer, and he also attended the theater frequently and would make Shakespearean references in his letters.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChernow2010172–76_278-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChernow2010172–76-278">[259]</a></sup> He drank in moderation and precisely recorded gambling wins and losses. He disliked the excessive drinking, gambling, smoking, and profanity that were common in colonial Virginia. He grew tobacco but he eventually stopped smoking and considered drunkenness a man's worst vice. He was glad that post-Revolutionary Virginia society was less likely to force guests "to drink and to make it an honor to send them home drunk."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChernow2010187–89_279-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChernow2010187–89-279">[260]</a></sup></p>

<p>For his entire life, Washington was affiliated with the established <a href="/wiki/Anglicanism" title="Anglicanism">Anglican Church</a> of Great Britain. It was dis-established in Southern states following the Revolution and reorganized as the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Episcopal_Church_(United_States)" title="History of the Episcopal Church (United States)">Episcopal Church</a>.

Numerous historians have suggested that Washington's theology agreed largely with the <a href="/wiki/Deism" title="Deism">Deists</a>, but he never expressed any particular Deist beliefs. He often used words for the deity such as "God" and "Providence", while avoiding using the names "Jesus" and "Christ." In his collected works, such terms appear in an official letter to Indians which might have been drafted by an aide. At the time, Deism was a theological outlook, not an organized denomination. It was compatible with being an Episcopalian. Historian Gregg Frazer argues that Washington was not a deist but a "<a href="/wiki/Theistic_rationalism" title="Theistic rationalism">theistic rationalist</a>." This theological position rejected core beliefs of Christianity, such as the divinity of Christ, the Trinity, and <a href="/wiki/Original_sin" title="Original sin">original sin</a>.

<p>Washington frequently accompanied his wife to church services.

<p>It is generally concluded that Washington was a Christian, although the exact nature of his religious beliefs has been debated by some historians and biographers for over 200 years.

<p>Washington had owned slaves since the death of his father in 1743, when he inherited 10 slaves. (Washington was 11 at the time.) He owned at least 36 slaves by the time of his marriage to Martha Custis in 1759, which meant that he had achieved the status of a major <a href="/wiki/Plantation#Planter_(plantation_owner)" title="Plantation">planter</a>. (Historians of the Upper South said that major planters owned 20 or more slaves.) Martha brought at least 85 "<a href="/wiki/Dower" title="Dower">dower</a> slaves" to Mount Vernon after their marriage, as she had inherited one third of her late husband's estate. Washington bought more land using his wife's great wealth, tripling the size of the plantation at Mount Vernon and purchasing the additional slaves needed to work it. By 1774, he paid taxes on 135 slaves (this figure does not include the dower slaves). The last record of a slave purchase by him was in 1772, although he later received some slaves in repayment of debts.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHirschfeld199711–12_310-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHirschfeld199711–12-310">[291]</a></sup> Washington also used some hired staff and white <a href="/wiki/Indentured_servant" class="mw-redirect" title="Indentured servant">indentured servants</a>; in April 1775, he offered a reward for the return of two runaway white servants.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHaworth200478—80_311-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHaworth200478—80-311">[292]</a></sup></p>
